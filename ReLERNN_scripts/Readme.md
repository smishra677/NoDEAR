# Run ReLERNN

## Requirement
- Install ReLERNN.

## Steps

1. **Change the folder name** to point to the appropriate equilibrium-trained 50kb folders.

2. **Use `train.sh`** to train ReLERNN on `0.vcf`.

3. **Use `test.sh`** to test ReLERNN on `0.vcf`â€“`120.vcf`.

> `vcf2hdf5.py` converts VCF into HDF5. (Thanks to Dr. Andy Kern for helping us figure this out.)
